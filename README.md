# Console Finances 

## Description

As a bootcamp student, I am implementing my knowledge of JavaScript in this challenge. I have been working with a dataset composed of arrays containing 2 fields of data (Date and Profit/loss.)
I have been using JavaScript to analyze this data, in order to print my results to the console. This has really helped me develop my ability to use my knowledge from class in a more practical scenario.

## Usage

My results can be found in the console when viewing my deployed application through github. Once the console is accessed (right-click, select inspect, go to console), you can view the results of my calculations. This includes the total number of months in the dataset, The net total profit and loss, and the average change between months.
